        "explanation": "When the result of a numeric operation is larger than the largest representable number (overflow), JavaScript prints the value as Infinity. Similarly, when a negative value becomes larger than the largest representable negative number, the result is negative infinity. The infinite values behave as you would expect: adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing them by anything results in an infinite value (possibly with the sign reversed).",

        ],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "Division by zero is not an error in JavaScript: it simply returns infinity or negative infinity. There is one exception, however: zero divided by zero does not have a well defined value, and the result of this operation is the special not-a-number value, printed as NaN.",

The more commonly-used abstract comparison (e.g. ==) converts the operands to the same type before making the comparison. The not-equal operator !== compares 0 to null and evaluates to either true or false.",
